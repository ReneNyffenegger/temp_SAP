SAP S/4HANA is SAP’s ERP for large enterprises and the next-generation business suite {
     S stands for simple.
     It is the successor of SAP R/3 and SAP ERP
     It is optimized for SAP HANA

     SAP ERP Java components are obsolete with SAP S/4HANA. 
       -> You have to remove the technical Java system from the respective productive system in the Landscape Management Database (LMDB).
     
     Two editions:
        - SAP S/4HANA On-Premise
        - SAP S/4HANA Cloud.
     
     Launch of S/4 HANA took place on 3 Febraury 2015.

     Prerequisites:
       - System needs to be a Unicode System
          --> Use  Unicode Conversion Overview (on SAP SCN)
       - AS ABAP-only system  
          (DUal stack systems (AS ABAP and AS Java combined in one system are not supported and need to be split before migration) [ SAP Note  1686144,  1686144 ]

       - Maintenance Planner

       - Cross-app & app-specific follow-on activities



      Prepare Phase {
  
       Maintenance Planner {
  
        You need to run the maintenance planner tool as a first step in the
        conversion process. It checks your components, add-ons, and business
        functions to ensure compatibility with SAP S/4HANA and also create the
        stack file used for the actual conversion process (done by the Software
        Update Manager tool).
  
       }
       Simplification Item-Check {
  
         These checks identify important steps you need to take to make sure that your system can technically be
         converted and that your business processes can start running directly after the conversion process has
         been completed.
  
         This step is mandatory and will be triggered again by the Software Update Manager. Ideally, you run the
         Simplification Item-Check (SI-Check) early in the process, so that you can take note of the planning
         information provided by the checks. Note that you no longer need the stack file for the checks
  
       }
       SAP Readiness Check {
  
         We highly recommend to run the SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANAin advance of your
         conversion project to identify any issues you need to consider and activities you need to do in
         preparation for your project.
  
       }
       Custom Code Migration {
  
         The custom code migration tool checks your custom code against a list of
         simplifications developed for SAP S/4HANA.

         update, and the data conversion.

         The tools SAP Readiness Check and Simplification Item-Check (SI-Check) are used to support the conversion
         process, see also Overview of the Conversion Process [page 8]. The following table explains the differences
         between the two tools.
